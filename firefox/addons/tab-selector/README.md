Tab-selector has two functionalities:
- logs to a file all active tabs for each open window
- activates a tab by entering its position e.g. entering 15 will activate the 15th tab, if it does exist, counting from left to right

This addon is meant to be used in conjunction with an external script/program that shows the list of open tabs allowing the user 
to switch to the desired tab without having to look for it in several firefox windows
